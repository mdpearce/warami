# Warami (an Android client for Lemmy)
## Overview
This is in the very early stages of development. Right now the UI is non-functional.

## API
The Lemmy API client in use was generated from the [Lemmy TS OpenAPI converter](https://github.com/mdpearce/lemmy-ts-openapi) as there is no official Lemmy API spec.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, but at this early stage as things are changing rapidly it may be non-trivial.

## Name
*Warami* is the [Dharug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharug) word for "Hello" / "Good to see you".

We acknowledge the Dharug people as the traditional custodians of the land in which this app is developed. We pay our respects to elders past and present, and acknowledge the Aboriginal people for their custodianship on this land.
